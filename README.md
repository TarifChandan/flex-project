# Spider-Man Landing Page Project

## Introduction

This project is a Spider-Man-themed landing page where I applied my knowledge of **Flexbox** to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. The primary focus of this project was to master Flexbox positioning and layout techniques, along with utilizing basic CSS properties like font styling and the box model.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used **Flexbox** extensively to build different sections of the landing page, ensuring proper alignment, spacing, and responsiveness. Below are the key sections created for the landing page:

- **Header Section**: Includes a navigation menu that was styled using Flexbox to align the list items horizontally.
- **Hero Section**: Contains large introductory text on the left side and a Spider-Man image on the right, laid out using Flexbox.
- **Spidey-Facts Section**: A four-column layout, each column consisting of an image and accompanying text, created using Flexbox for easy alignment.
- **Testimonials Section**: Features a quote from Spider-Man's villain, Green Goblin. The quote was styled with larger, italicized, and lighter text for emphasis.
- **CTA Section**: A Call-to-Action section encouraging users to join the web. This section uses Flexbox to position the text on the left and a button on the right.
- **Footer Section**: Contains centered copyright text.

The page layout and structure were designed to highlight the use of **Flexbox**, while additional styling was applied using the box model, margins, paddings, and font stylings with **Roboto** font from Google Fonts.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

1. **Flexbox Layout**:
   - Aligned multiple divs side by side using Flexbox.
   - Applied `justify-content: space-between` and other properties to distribute spacing effectively between elements.
2. **Typography and Font Styling**:

   - Integrated **Roboto** font and applied different font sizes and weights.
   - Styled headings, paragraphs, and the testimonial quote for emphasis.

3. **Box Model**:
   - Used margins, paddings, and borders to ensure proper spacing and positioning across elements.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the skills I have developed in Flexbox positioning and web layout design. From the header to the footer, every section was built with the intention of mastering flexbox, text styling, and box-model principles. Through this Spider-Man landing page, I’ve applied my learnings in an engaging way, and I’m excited to continue expanding my skills as a web developer.
